Bixo has some early, limited support for working with DMOZ data.

The Open Directory Project makes available RDF dumps of their database,
which are free for all to use. See http://rdf.dmoz.org/ for details.

Bixo has some tools, located in the bixo.tools package, that can process
the dmoz.xml file (1.9GB) to extract links (ExtractDmozLinks) and
unique domains (ExtractDmozDomains).

In addition, the links extracted from a recent DMOZ database are
available from the Bixo Nexus server at:

http://oss.101tec.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases/bixo/dmoz-links/

See also doc/licenses/open-directory-license.txt for licence information
related to the DMOZ data.
