Introduction
===============================

Bixo is an open source Java crawler that runs as a series of Cascading
pipes. It is designed to be used as a tool for creating customized
crawlers, thus each Cascading pipe implements a discrete operation. By
building a customized Cascading pipe assembly, you can quickly create
specialized crawlers that are optimized for a particular use case.

Bixo borrows heavily from the Apache Nutch project, as well as many other
open source projects at Apache and elsewhere.

Bixo is released under the MIT license.
