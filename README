Introduction
===============================

Bixo is an open source Java crawler that runs as a series of Cascading
pipes. It is designed to be used as a tool for creating customized
crawlers, thus each Cascading pipe implements a discrete operation. By
building a customized Cascading pipe assembly, you can quickly create
specialized crawlers that are optimized for a particular use case.

Bixo borrows heavily from the Apache Nutch project, as well as many other
open source projects at Apache and elsewhere.

Bixo is released under the MIT license.

Building
===============================

To build, you first need:

1. A recent release of Cascading that works with Hadoop 0.19.0+

http://cascading.googlecode.com/files/cascading-1.0.6-hadoop-0.19.0%2B.tgz

2. A recent release of Hadoop 0.19

http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/core/

3. A build.properties file in the same directory as the build.xml file

This file should contain:

hadoop.home=<path to Hadoop you just downloaded>
cascading.home=<path to Cascading you just downloaded>

Note that you can't use user-relative paths here, e.g. ~/<path> won't work.
They need to be either absolute or relative to the project directory.

4. Run ant test to compile & test the code.
