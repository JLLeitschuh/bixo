Introduction
===============================

Bixo is an open source Java web mining tooklit that runs as a series of Cascading
pipes. It is designed to be used as a tool for creating customized web mining apps.
By building a customized Cascading pipe assembly, you can quickly create a workflow
using Bixo that fetches web content, parses, analyzes, and publishes the results.

Bixo borrows heavily from the Apache Nutch project, as well as many other open source
rojects at Apache and elsewhere.

Bixo is released under the MIT license.
