it with a starting domain name (e.g. cnn.com) and a user agent name,
and it will crawl for the specified number of loops.

The WebMiningTool demonstrates a focused crawler with a focus on 
extracting (un)structured data from web pages. It demonstrateds how 
to analyze the fetched data from a page using a DOM parser.
