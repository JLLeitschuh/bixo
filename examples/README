The "examples" folder contains a set of examples to showcase Bixo.

The SimpleCrawlTool demonstrates a simple web crawler. You provide
it with a starting domain name (e.g. cnn.com) and a user agent name,
and it will crawl for the specified number of loops.

The WebMiningTool demonstrates a focused crawler with a focus on 
extracting (un)structured data from web pages. It demonstrates how 
to analyze the fetched data from a page using a DOM parser.  


To build a job jar:

% cd <path to Bixo>/examples
% ant clean job

To run the job jar:

% hadoop jar build/bixo-examples-job-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar bixo.examples.crawl.SimpleCrawlTool \
	-agentname <your agent name> -domain <target domain> -numloops <number of loops> -outputdir <results dir>

Note that you should pick a number of loops > 1, so that it crawls more than just the top-level
page of your target domain.

To create an Eclipse project:

% cd <path to Bixo>/examples
% ant eclipse

after which you would import the project into your Eclipse workspace.
